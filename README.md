# MetaWear-Tutorial-Matlab
Matlab example scripts for the MetaWear platform. Please see our [tutorials]( https://mbientlab.com/tutorials/) for more.

## Overview

[MetaWear](https://mbientlab.com) is a complete development and production platform for wearable and connected device applications.

MetaWear features a number of sensors and peripherals all easily controllable over Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy using this SDK, no firmware or hardware experience needed!

The MetaWear hardware comes pre-loaded with a wirelessly upgradeable firmware, so it keeps getting more powerful over time.

## Requirements

- [MetaWear board](https://mbientlab.com/store/)
- [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), with a license and the following Toolboxes: Instrument Control Toolbox and Aerospace Toolbox.
- Desktop running Windows 10 with Bluetooth 4.0 (you may need a Bluetooth dongle)

## Foreword

These scripts have only been tested on Windows and Matlab R2018a

# Improve Our Tutorial (Pull-Request)

## Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your machine. Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone https://github.com/mbientlab/MetaWear-Tutorial-Matlab.git
```
## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd MetaWear-Tutorial-Matlab
```
Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b <add-your-new-branch-name>
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add .
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Change to quat script for cube shape by @ghost_dev"
```

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```
replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

Submit the pull request.

If we accept it, you will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.

## Where to go from here?

Thank you for helping us make Matlab support for the MetaWear platform better!
